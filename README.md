# leaves drying with temperature control (DHT22 & relay)

   Controlling heat generated(heat is generated by  100W bulbs) to dry leaves.
   Tempeature reading of the sorrounding  taken by DHT sensor,.
   The whole control is achieved by on-off mechanism of the relay(turn on/off the bulbs)
   temperature readings and status are then updated on the LCD(I2C LCD)
   Buzzer and LEDs are used to give quick notification on the status
   
   **Note: i2c pins on arduino uno and nano are**
   
   sck---> A5
   
   dt----> A4

   Using built-in I2C scanner example *(File->Examples->Wire->i2c scanner)*,
   scan its I2C address(this address is used when creating an instance of LiquidCrystal_I2C)

**The components  used**
 - Arduino Nano
 - DHT22( temperature sensor)
 - Relay
 - LCD(I2C)
 - LEDs
